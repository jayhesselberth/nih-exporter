</h2>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the major source of
federal funding for biomedical research in the United States. Analysis
of past and current NIH funding can illustrate funding trends and
identify productive research topics, but these analyses are conducted
<em>ad hoc</em> by the institutes themselves and only provide a small
glimpse of the available data. The NIH provides free access to funding
data via NIH EXPORTER, but few tools have been developed to enable
analysis of these data.</p>
<p>We developed the <code>nihexporter</code> R package, which provides
access to <a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/exporter" class="external-link">NIH EXPORTER</a>
data. We used the package to develop several analysis vignettes that
show funding trends across NIH institutes over &gt;20 years and
highlight differences in how institutes change their funding profiles.
Investigators and institutions can use the package to perform
self-studies of their own NIH funding.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#introduction"></a>
</h2>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the major source federal
funds for biomedical research in the United States. The NIH budget is
approved by Congress each year. The NIH is divided into 25 institutes,
each with its own focus and mission. For example, National Cancer
Institute (NCI) focuses on malignant diseases; the National Institute
for Allergy and Immune Disease focuses on the immune system and
infectious disease; and the National Institute for General Medical
Sciences focuses on basic research, without a specific disease focus.
Each institute negotiates with the NIH director for its yearly budget,
with budget institutes ranging from millions to several billion
dollars.</p>
<p>The NIH provides funds through competitive grants written by internal
and external investigators, and the funds associated with these grants
can be divided into ‘direct’ and ‘indirect’ costs. <strong>Direct
costs</strong> are funds that are given to an investigator (or group of
investigators) to conduct their proposed research. These funds buy
supplies for the experiments and pay the salaries of people to do the
work.</p>
<p>By contrast, <strong>indirect costs</strong> are funds that are paid
to institutions associated with investigators, and are used to “keep the
lights on”: they pay for infrastructure costs. However, the “indirect
cost recovery” (ICR) rate of each institution, the fraction of each
award the institute receives, is congressionally mandated, and there is
a wide range in ICR rates. Some of the highest ICR rates are close to
100%, meaning that for every dollar an investigator receives, the
institutions receive an equal amount.</p>
<p>NIH funding is an investment strategy: the institutes invest money in
specific research areas, hoping for future returns in the form of new
technologies and treatents, publications, patents, and skilled trainees.
As with any investment strategy, a periodic review can help rebalance
the portfolio in order to maximize returns. Analysis of NIH funding data
has been performed internally by the NIH, or by contracted
third-parties. Several of these analyses have highlighted funding trends
and suggested metrics to gauge the ‘return’ on the NIH ‘investment’. For
example, “productivity” can be examined as a function of the number of
publications produced by grants per dollar of “direct costs”.</p>

<h2 id="methods">Methods<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#methods"></a>
</h2>
<p>We downloaded NIH funding data from the NIH EXPORTER website in
comma-separated value (CSV) format and parsed these data into R data
files that each contain specific information:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>projects</code> has information about projects in each fiscal
year, keyed by <code>project.num</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>project_pis</code> links PI information to a project</li>
<li>
<code>publinks</code> table links PubMed IDs to
<code>project.num</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>publications</code> links project IDs to PubMed IDs</li>
<li>
<code>patents</code> links patent IDs to project IDs</li>
</ul>
<p>See the documentation in the R package for more information about
each table.</p>
<p>The package also has several precomputed variables and tables that
enable quick and easy exploratory analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>nih_institutes</code>: Two-letter format for 27 NIH
institutes</li>
<li>
<code>project_io</code>: This table contains pre-computed values for
overall project cost (<code>project_cost</code>), as well as the number
of publications (<code>n_pubs</code>) and patents
(<code>n_patents</code>) associated with each project.</li>
</ul>
<p>NIH EXPORTER provides access to the total costs of each grant in each
fiscal year, comprising both direct and indirect costs.</p>

<p>One can also examine how dollars are accrued by specific PIs. It is
not possible to assign dollars directly to a PI, because some grants

identify PIs with the largest dollar amounts accrued for R01 grants.</p>

<p>To measure the return on the NIH investment, we can measure scholarly
output (i.e., publications) per dollar invested.</p>
<p>Here we identify th highest performing grants outside of the R01
category. Much has been made of the wasteful spending outside of
investigator-initiated research. Here we identify the cost of
publications for grants other than R01s.</p>

<a href="https://www.nigms.nih.gov/about/director/pages/berg.aspx" class="external-link">Jeremy
Berg</a> was head of the Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)
from 2003-2011, he routinely provided analysis of funding trends at
NIGMS in his “Feedback Loop” blog. One of these measured the
productivity per grant dollar by measuring its “scholarly output”
(<em>i.e.</em>, publications) as a function of direct costs. In this <a href="https://loop.nigms.nih.gov/2010/09/measuring-the-scientific-output-and-impact-of-nigms-grants/" class="external-link">plot</a>
there is an increase in productivity per dollar, until an inflection
point at $700K, after which the number of publications <em>drops</em>,
suggesting a negative influence of grant money on scholarly output. This
was interesting and covered <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/468356a" class="external-link">here</a>.</p>
<p>Here we flesh out this analysis and look at how all institutes
perform by this measure (Berg, and now Lorsch, only analyzed GM). One
caveat is that we only have access to <code>total.cost</code> in NIH
EXPORTER, so the numbers include indirect costs. But, this is real cost
to the tax-payer.</p>
<p>First, we need to calculate the lifetime costs of all R01 grants.</p>

<p>Next, we need to identify grants in each of the bins that Berg
previously alluded to. <code>dplyr</code> makes this easy with the
<code>ntile()</code> function. Berg previously divided grants into ~15
bins, we’ll bin into ~5%.</p>
