NIH budget approved Congress year, fiscal year 2014, total NIH budget 30.3 billion dollars (REF). NIH divided 25 institutes, focus mission. example, National Cancer Institue (NCI) focuses malignant diseases; National Institute Allergy Immune Disease focuses immune system transmissible diseasei; National Institute General Medical Sciences focuses basic research without specific disease focus. institute negotiates NIH director (currently Francis Collins, MD, PhD) yearly budget, budget institutes ranging millions several billion dollars. NIH provides funds competitive grants written internal external investigators, funds associated grants can divided ‘direct’ ‘indirect’ costs. Direct costs funds given investigator (group investigators) conduct proposed research. funds buy supplies experiments pay salaries people work. contrast, indirect costs funds paid institutions associated investigators, used “keep lights ”: pay infrastructure costs. However, “indirect cost recovery” (ICR) rate institution, fraction award institute receives, congressionally mandated, wide range ICR rates. highest ICR rates close 100%, meaning every dollar investigator receives, institutions receive equal amount. NIH funding investment strategy: institutes invest money specific research areas, hoping future returns form publications, patents skilled trainees. investment strategy, periodic review can help rebalance portfolio order maximize returns. Analysis NIH funding data performed internally NIH, contracted third-parties. Several analyses highlighted funding trends suggested metrics gauge ‘return’ NIH ‘investment’. example, “productivity” can examined function number publications produced grants per dollar “direct costs”.","code":""},{"path":"/articles/nihexporter.html","id":"methods","dir":"Articles","previous_headings":"","what":"Methods","title":"Introduction to nihexporter","text":"downloaded NIH funding data NIH EXPORTER website comma-separated value (CSV) format parsed data R data files contain specific information: projects information projects fiscal year, keyed project.num org_info information project organizations project_orgs links applications organizations project_pis links PI information project publinks table links PubMed IDs project.num publications links project IDs PubMed IDs patents links patent IDs project IDs See documentation R package information table. package also several precomputed variables tables enable quick easy exploratory analysis: nih_institutes: Two-letter format 27 NIH institutes project_io: table contains pre-computed values overall project cost (project_cost), well number publications (n_pubs) patents (n_patents) associated project.
